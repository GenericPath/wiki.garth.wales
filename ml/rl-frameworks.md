# RL frameworks

My primary experience is with TensorFlow, therefore any methods that don't support it aren't considered.

A good source of information

Keras-RL had last commit in 2019, basically dead now although still functional.  
_\(e.g. documentation is partially completed\)_

[Tensorforce ](https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce/)looks pretty good, [RLLib](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html) looks even better but is quite different.

Google Dopamine and TF-Agents are both from Google researchers. Dopamine aims at fast prototyping vs TF-Agent for production-level rl algorithms.

Actually [garage](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage) looks pretty good, but it's documentation is less exposed than other methods.
