### Week 6 \(Easter break\)

**6/06 - Tuesday**

Working out which methods I want to use  
[i.e. looking at A Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Frameworks: Dopamine, RLLib, Keras-RL, Coach, TRFL, Tensorforce, Coach and more](https://winderresearch.com/a-comparison-of-reinforcement-learning-frameworks-dopamine-rllib-keras-rl-coach-trfl-tensorforce-coach-and-more/)  
  
Stable baselines still has the best implementation of everything, but looks hardest to work with.
