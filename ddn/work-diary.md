Initial meeting. Steve is interested in use for 3D segmentation, for this attempt will start with 2D segmentation. Masters could be doing the 3D segmentation instead.

The initial plan is to test out their code, decide if I want to use PyTorch or Tensorflow. Use deeper (or deepest) but possibly need the more powerful cards. Only one other should be using deeper currently. NeSI is always an option if needed.

Other possible areas to look into are geometric deep learning (they are interesting), light field networks (unlikely).



Main goals:

Lech: Stability of DNN (and feasibility)

Steve: 2D image segementation

Installing pytorch and testing basics of the ddn framework supplied by original authors as well as Blind PnP problem ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14628.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14628.pdf), [https://github.com/dylan-campbell/bpnpnet](https://github.com/dylan-campbell/bpnpnet))
