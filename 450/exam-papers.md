# Exam papers

## Botteril et al \(Real-Time Aerial Image Mosaicing\)

Fast instead of sift blobs for SPEED

* Using corners means no invariance to most things, but the drone flies in a straight line continuously so might be less important.
* Using corners doesn't have as good

## Mills \(4 and 7 point algorithms\)

Biggest disadvantage

* SLAM sorta thing, it doesn't do well if no rotation or side to side motion leading to high reprojection error \(for the 4 point algorithm\)

## Broxton et al \(Immersive Light Field Video\)

Difference between lightfields and multi-plane images

* Multi-plane changed to a sphere representation allowing you to look around more. IMMERSIVE! More DoF for viewing.
