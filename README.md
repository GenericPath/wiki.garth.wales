# Introduction

This is my personal wiki, created with [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com).

I'm endeavouring to document topics around my postgraduate studies, and possibly any other useful tidbits. These will mostly cover machine learning and reinforcement learning.



TODO:\
Update main website with similar code to [https://smolcss.dev/](https://smolcss.dev)

and something similar to [http://bamos.github.io/](http://bamos.github.io) ?



also for any future paper writing: [https://www.mathcha.io](https://www.mathcha.io) to utilise drawing into TikZ for LaTeX
