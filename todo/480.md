# 480

* Switch to Tensorforce or stable-baselines
  * NB: stable-baselines 3.1 will include all the pieces for rainbow
* Create a gym environment for the face detection task

Issues:

* We have to take the whole image in each time \(can't determine where features are in the image..\)
* We would have to preprocess for
  * Grayscale
  * Rescale images \(VGG is 224x224, so need to rescale the trimmed images? or do we not trim?\)
